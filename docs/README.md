The power injector module is a part of the CAN4VSCP family of modules. The module is designed to power the CAN4VSCP bus.Three versions of the module exists, a small version that can power the bus and up to 2 CAN4VSCP modules, a medium version that can power the bus and up to 8 CAN4VSCP modules and a big version that can power the bus and up to 16 CAN4VSCP modules. Only the big version is currently active.

**Power Injector big** is a module that can power the CAN4VSCP bus and also power up to 16 CAN4VSCP modules using the inter module connector. This is a perfect companion board to use when you need to connect a number of CAN4VSCP boards in a cabinet and then connect them to the world.

The module can be powered from 7 to 28 VDC and can deliver up to 500 mA on the CAN4VSCP bus. The module has a number of safety features like over current shutdown (800mA) and reverse polarity protection.
