Power Injector is a module that can power the CAN4VSCP bus and also power up to 16 CAN4VSCP modules using the daisy chain connector. This is a perfect companion board to use when you need to connect a number of CAN4VSCP boards in a cabinet and then connect them to the world.

The module can be powered from 7 to 28 VDC and can deliver up to 2A on the CAN4VSCP bus. The module has a number of safety features like over current shutdown and reverse polarity protection.
