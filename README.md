<img src="http://www.grodansparadis.com/powerinjector/can4vscp_big/images/power_injector8_800.png" width="600">

With the power injector you can power the CAN4VSCP bus and also power up to 16 CAN4VSCP modules using the daisy chain connector. This is a perfect companion board to use when you need to connect a number of CAN4VSCP boards in a cabinet and then connect them to thw world.

It also have two 120 ohm terminations that can be activated if needed.

It is also possible to get the module with a resettable fuse that allow a maximum of 500 mA for all modules connected to the board. The fuse will trip at about 800 mA. This can be a good safety precaution for wired networks.
